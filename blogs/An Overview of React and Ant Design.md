**An overview of React's features:**

* Declarative
> Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
* Component-Based
> Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
> Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* Learn Once, Write Anywhere
> React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
